# Added elements and their purpose
SSL certificate: Used to secure exchanges between the user and the site (HTTPS). It protects sensitive data.

3 Firewalls: Protect the various elements of the system by blocking unauthorised traffic.

3 Monitoring agents: Monitor server activity and detect problems.

# Role of firewalls
They filter network traffic to prevent malicious or unauthorised connections.

# Why HTTPS
HTTPS encrypts data sent by the user to prevent it being intercepted (for example: passwords).

# Why monitor
This makes it possible to:

Detect bugs or failures quickly

Track performance (e.g. traffic, errors)

Receive alerts if something goes wrong

# How monitoring works
Software (agent) installed on the servers:

Reads log files

Observes system performance

Sends this data to a central tool for analysis (exemple sumologic)

# How to monitor QPS (requests per second)
We can :

Read the web server log files

Or use a tool that displays the number of requests per second (e.g. Prometheus export for Nginx)

# Possible problems with this architecture
SSL terminated at load balancer level: traffic afterwards is no longer encrypted â†’ risk if the internal network is hacked.

A single MySQL write database: if it goes down, it's no longer possible to write data (backup plan ?).

All the servers have the same roles: not flexible, difficult to upgrade, a single problem can break everything.
